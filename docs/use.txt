Plugin Options
==============

This plugin is enabled once installed and provides the following
options for making `nose` behave a bit better:

.. option:: --test-suite-func <test_suite>

  This option makes `nose` respect modules
  that contain unit tests but define a function that returns the suite
  containing those tests rather than expecting the test runner to
  collect them directly.

  The name of this function is expected to be ``test_suite`` by default,
  if you require a different name to be used, please invoke nose as
  follows::

    $ nosetests --test-suite-func=your_func_name

.. option:: --show-docstrings

  By default, this plugin prevents docstrings in tests from being used as
  test names in the test run output. You can turn this behaviour off by
  passing the ``--show-docstrings`` option on the command-line.
